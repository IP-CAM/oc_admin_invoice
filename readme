By Default, Opencart sends an invoice to the customer after a purchase is made and provides the option of having a "notification" sent to the admin on file.

This mod sends the invoice to the administrator on file.

Make sure that no email is inserted in the mail parameter section of settings/mail in the admin section if "mail protocal: mail" has been selected or you will receive duplicate emails.

Also, deselect New Order Alert Mail if you do not wish to have the original alert mail sent to you.
